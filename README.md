T3v3 - Joomla Responsive Template Framework, built with Bootstrap & LESS
==============


The 3rd generation of JA T3 Framework - re-written from the scratch to support Bootstrap & LESS.  

Why?
- No longer the Mobile layout/view but the rise of Responsive Design
- Bootstrap integration into Joomla 3.x 
- LESS development 

These 3 things have opened a whole new way of how a Joomla template should be developed.
